# JF Ratt Roads v1.2 (2023-10-05)

This NewGRF provides a complete set of 24 roadtypes (15 normal and [optionally] 9 electrified) plus 2 tramtypes. It has support for American, European and Australian road styles, climate-aware graphics, plus many parameters for customizing to your preferred playstyle.

It (with this readme) is highly based on RattRoads and Auz Ratt Roads, thus "Auz Ratt Roads John Franklin Fork" previously.

**WARNING: This NewGRF version is not compatible with any version before v1.2!**

**WARNING: This NewGRF is only compatible with OpenTTD 1.10.0 or later!**
